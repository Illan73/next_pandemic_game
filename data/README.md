# Data Directory ðŸ“Š

This directory contains all datasets used in the Next Pandemic Game simulation, organized by source and processing stage.

## Structure

### `raw/`
Unprocessed, original datasets as downloaded or collected:
- **Viral sequence data** from NCBI GenBank, GISAID
- **Spillover event records** from scientific literature and databases
- **Population and demographic data** from UN, World Bank, census data
- **Animal host and reservoir data** from wildlife databases
- **Climate and environmental data** from meteorological services

### `processed/`
Cleaned, standardized datasets ready for analysis:
- **Viral family characteristics** - standardized risk factors, transmission modes
- **Historical pandemic timeline** - dates, locations, impact metrics
- **Host-pathogen networks** - species associations and spillover pathways
- **Geographic risk maps** - spatial data on high-risk regions

### `external/`
Scripts and configurations for real-time data connections:
- **WHO surveillance APIs** - current outbreak monitoring
- **ECDC threat assessments** - European disease surveillance
- **ProMED alerts** - global disease outbreak reports
- **Scientific database APIs** - automated literature monitoring
