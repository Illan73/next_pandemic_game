## Risk Assessment Integration

### Early Warning Triggers
- **Threshold exceedance**: Statistical anomalies in routine surveillance
- **Novel pathogen detection**: First identification of new variants/species
- **Geographic spread**: Expansion beyond typical endemic areas
- **Severity changes**: Increased hospitalization or case fatality rates

### Risk Scoring Components
- **Signal strength**: Statistical significance of anomalies
- **Biological plausibility**: Consistency with known pathogen behavior  
- **Geographic scope**: Local, national, or international spread potential
- **Population vulnerability**: Demographics and immunity status

### Pandemic Risk Indicators
- **Human-to-human transmission**: Sustained community spread evidence
- **International spread**: Cases in multiple countries/continents
- **Healthcare system impact**: Hospital capacity strain indicators
- **Countermeasure effectiveness**: Response measure success rates

## Data Quality and Limitations

### Surveillance System Strengths
- **Real-time reporting**: Many systems provide daily/weekly updates
- **Global coverage**: Networks span all WHO regions
- **Standardized protocols**: Common case definitions and reporting formats
- **Expert validation**: Professional epidemiologist review and verification

### Known Limitations
- **Reporting delays**: 1-2 week lag in many systems
- **Geographic gaps**: Limited coverage in resource-constrained regions
- **Ascertainment bias**: Severe cases more likely to be detected
