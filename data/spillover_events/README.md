# Spillover Events Data ü¶á‚û°Ô∏èüßë

Historical and contemporary data on zoonotic spillover events that led to human infections or outbreaks.

## Overview

This directory contains structured data on documented spillover events where pathogens jumped from animal hosts to humans. These events are critical for understanding pandemic risk patterns and validating predictive models.

## Data Structure

### Core Dataset Fields
- **event_id**: Unique identifier for each spillover event
- **pathogen_name**: Scientific name of the pathogen involved
- **pathogen_family**: Viral family classification (e.g., Coronaviridae, Paramyxoviridae)
- **spillover_date**: Date of first documented human infection (YYYY-MM-DD)
- **location**: Geographic coordinates and administrative boundaries
- **animal_host**: Primary animal reservoir or intermediate host
- **human_cases**: Number of confirmed human infections
- **transmission_mode**: Route of transmission (respiratory, vector-borne, direct contact)
- **outcome**: Limited outbreak, epidemic, or pandemic status

### Risk Factors Tracked
- **Environmental drivers**: Deforestation, climate change, urbanization
- **Human behavior**: Wildlife contact, bushmeat consumption, travel patterns
- **Pathogen characteristics**: Mutation rate, receptor binding affinity
- **Host factors**: Population density, immune status, co-infections

## Key Spillover Categories

### 1. Respiratory Viruses
- **SARS-CoV (2003)**: Bats ‚Üí civets ‚Üí humans in China
- **MERS-CoV (2012)**: Bats ‚Üí camels ‚Üí humans in Middle East  
- **SARS-CoV-2 (2019)**: Likely bat origin, emergence in China
- **Influenza variants**: Continuous spillover from birds and pigs

### 2. Hemorrhagic Fever Viruses
- **Ebola outbreaks**: Multiple spillovers from bats in Central/West Africa
- **Marburg virus**: Bat-to-human transmission in caves and mines
- **Lassa fever**: Rodent reservoirs in West Africa
- **Nipah virus**: Bat spillover via pigs and palm sap in Asia

### 3. Vector-Borne Viruses
- **Zika virus**: Sylvatic cycle spillover, urban adaptation
- **Chikungunya**: Multiple spillover events from primates
- **West Nile virus**: Bird reservoir, mosquito-mediated spillover
- **Rift Valley fever**: Livestock spillover during flooding events

### 4. Rodent-Borne Viruses
- **Hantavirus**: Multiple spillover events from rodent reservoirs
- **Lassa fever**: Chronic spillover in endemic regions
- **Bolivian hemorrhagic fever**: Agricultural spillover patterns

## Data Sources

### Primary Sources
- **WHO Disease Outbreak News**: Official outbreak reports and investigations
- **CDC Outbreak Investigations**: Detailed epidemiological studies
- **ProMED-mail Archives**: Real-time disease surveillance reports
- **Peer-reviewed literature**: Published spillover event analyses

### Specialized Databases
- **PREDICT Database**: Wildlife-human interface surveillance
- **EID2 Database**: Emerging infectious disease events
- **GIDEON**: Global infectious disease epidemiology
- **HealthMap**: Automated disease surveillance and mapping

## Temporal Patterns

### Pre-2000 Era
- Limited systematic surveillance
- Major events: HIV emergence, influenza pandemics
- Focus on well-documented historical events

### 2000-2010
- Increased surveillance capacity
- SARS, H5N1 influenza, H1N1 pandemic
- Improved molecular characterization

### 2010-Present  
- Real-time genomic surveillance
- COVID-19 pandemic and variants
- Enhanced One Health approaches
- Climate change impacts documented

## Geographic Hotspots

### High-Risk Regions
- **Southeast Asia**: Dense human-wildlife interfaces, live animal markets
- **Central/West Africa**: Bushmeat consumption, forest fragmentation  
- **Amazon Basin**: Deforestation, indigenous community exposure
- **Central Asia**: Livestock intensification, climate variability

### Risk Factors by Region
- **Tropical regions**: High viral diversity, year-round transmission
- **Deforestation zones**: Habitat disruption, novel contacts
- **Urban-rural interfaces**: Population growth, land use change
- **Conflict zones**: Weakened surveillance, population displacement

## Data Quality Assessment

### Completeness Scoring
- **High**: Complete epidemiological investigation with genomic data
- **Medium**: Basic outbreak investigation with pathogen identification
- **Low**: Reported event with limited verification or characterization

### Verification Methods
- **Cross-reference validation**: Multiple independent sources
- **Genomic confirmation**: Molecular evidence of spillover
- **Epidemiological plausibility**: Consistent with known transmission patterns
- **Expert review**: Validation by domain specialists

## Future Data Needs

### Surveillance Gaps
- **Underreported regions**: Limited surveillance in remote areas
- **Asymptomatic spillovers**: Serological surveys needed
- **Subclinical events**: Mild spillovers that don't trigger investigation
- **Wildlife reservoir mapping**: Systematic host-pathogen surveys

### Enhanced Characterization
- **Spillover frequency**: Population-level seroprevalence studies
- **Failed spillovers**: Events that didn't establish human transmission
- **Environmental triggers**: Climate and land-use correlations
- **Intervention effectiveness**: Impact of prevention measures

## Usage Notes

- **Temporal bias**: More recent events better documented
- **Geographic bias**: Overrepresentation of well-surveilled regions  
- **Reporting bias**: Severe outcomes more likely to be documented
- **Detection bias**: Emerging surveillance technologies improve recent detection

This dataset serves as the empirical foundation for spillover risk modeling and pandemic preparedness planning.
