# Next Pandemic Game 🦠

**Exploring pandemic risk through viral families, spillovers & human behavior**

This educational project explores which viruses might cause the next human pandemic — and why. Built as an interactive simulator, it incorporates data on virology, ecology, and behavior to assess pandemic risk factors and model potential emergence scenarios.

## 🎯 Project Overview

The Next Pandemic Game is a science-based simulation tool that combines:
- **Epidemiological modeling** using R for statistical analysis and disease dynamics
- **Data integration** using Python for real-time data collection and processing  
- **Risk assessment** based on peer-reviewed literature and current surveillance data
- **Interactive visualization** for exploring different scenarios and outcomes

## 🧬 Scientific Foundation

This project is grounded in:
- Systematic literature review of pandemic risk factors
- Analysis of high-risk viral families and their characteristics
- Historical spillover event data and patterns
- Current global surveillance and early warning systems
