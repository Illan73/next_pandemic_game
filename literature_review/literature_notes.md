**Title:** Next pandemic – What are the chances and which virus is more likely to cause it?  
**Source:** Falcon – Deep Search, Futurehouse Platform (2025)

**Summary:**  
This technical report provides an AI-generated review on the probability and causes of the next pandemic. It synthesizes literature on zoonotic spillovers, viral genomics, and environmental factors. It identifies influenza viruses and coronaviruses as top candidates due to their mutation rates and history of pandemics. Key elements include ecological risk factors, spillover pathways, and predictive indicators.

**Key Insights:**  
- Pandemic emergence is strongly linked to zoonotic interfaces and ecological disruption.
- Influenza and CoVs are leading candidates due to high adaptability.
- The report follows a structured scientific layout (like IEEE) and integrates 20 cited works.

**Relevance to Project:**  
Provides a comprehensive foundation for structuring the “Next Pandemic Game” around key risk families and ecological triggers.
