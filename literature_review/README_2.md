# Literature Review Directory ðŸ“–

Systematic review of scientific literature on pandemic risk factors, viral emergence, and outbreak prediction.

## Review Scope

### Search Strategy
- **Databases**: PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, bioRxiv/medRxiv
- **Time period**: 2000-present (with key historical references)
- **Languages**: English, with abstracts in other languages considered
- **Study types**: Original research, systematic reviews, modeling studies

### Key Topics
1. **Zoonotic spillover mechanisms** - Host switching, viral evolution
2. **Pandemic risk factors** - Environmental, social, biological determinants  
3. **Early warning systems** - Surveillance methods, prediction models
4. **Viral family characteristics** - Transmission modes, mutation rates
5. **Historical pandemic analysis** - Patterns, lessons learned

## File Organization

### `references.bib`

## Quality Assessment

Each source is evaluated for:
- **Study design quality** - Appropriate methods, adequate sample sizes
- **Data reliability** - Source credibility, transparency
- **Relevance** - Direct applicability to pandemic risk assessment
- **Recency** - Currency of information, especially for rapidly evolving topics

## Synthesis Approach

Literature findings are synthesized into:
- **Evidence tables** - Systematic comparison of study results
- **Risk factor rankings** - Quantitative synthesis where possible
- **Research gaps matrix** - Identified needs for future work
- **Model parameter estimates** - Literature-derived values for simulation
