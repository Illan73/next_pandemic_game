## Abstract

The probability of a future pandemic has become a subject of significant scientific concern in recent decades. Multiple lines of evidence – from ecological and epidemiological studies to advances in viral genomics and predictive modeling – converge on the conclusion that the next pandemic is not a question of *if* but *when* \cite{casadevall2024pandemics, morens2020emerging}. Ongoing environmental modifications, increased global connectivity, and the intensification of human activities at the animal–human interface have collectively amplified the risk of zoonotic spillover events \cite{dharmarajan2022animal}. Among a broad array of viral candidates, influenza viruses and coronaviruses consistently emerge as the most likely causes of the next global outbreak due to their high mutation rates, capacity for rapid genetic reassortment or recombination, and well‐documented history of causing pandemics \cite{neumann2023which, harrington2021evolution}. This report reviews the interrelated risk factors, discusses the evolutionary and ecological dynamics of viral emergence, and presents a comparative analysis of the virus families most frequently implicated in pandemic outbreaks. In addition, we discuss the role of predictive models and surveillance systems aimed at early detection and mitigating risk through a One Health approach.

## I. Introduction

A history marked by multiple pandemics – including the 1918 Spanish influenza, the 2009 H1N1 influenza, the SARS outbreak of 2002–2003, the MERS outbreak, and most recently the COVID-19 pandemic – underscores the inevitability of future pandemics \cite{morens2020emerging}. Over recent decades, a multiplicity of risk factors such as ecological disruption, global travel, urbanization, intensified wildlife–human interactions, and agricultural intensification has fundamentally altered the environment in which pathogens evolve and emerge \cite{casadevall2024pandemics, dharmarajan2022animal}. The inherent genetic plasticity of RNA viruses coupled with the expanding human footprint into natural habitats has increased the reservoir of potential pathogens capable of crossing species barriers \cite{neumann2023which}. Although advances in biosurveillance and predictive modeling have improved our understanding of viral spillover \cite{quer2022next, kamalrathne2023need}, uncertainty remains regarding the exact timing and identity of the next pandemic pathogen. This report synthesizes current research insights into pandemic probability and highlights the viral families that, by a consensus of recent studies, appear most likely to cause the next global outbreak.

## II. Epidemiological and Ecological Determinants of Pandemic Emergence

### A. Global Environmental and Social Drivers

Global climate change, deforestation, urban sprawl, and environmental degradation have accelerated habitat disruption and forced wildlife into closer proximity to human settlements \cite{coccia2023sources, dharmarajan2022animal}. This increased contact creates new opportunities for zoonotic viruses to cross species barriers \cite{casadevall2024pandemics}. The breakdown of historical ecological boundaries has facilitated viral sharing across host species, expanding the "risk space" for emerging infectious diseases \cite{carlson2021future}. Additionally, globalized trade and rapid international travel have enabled pathogens to spread over vast distances \cite{gray2021mitigating, coccia2023sources}.

### B. Human–Wildlife Interactions and Spillover Dynamics

Encroachment into previously undisturbed ecosystems results in more frequent interactions between humans and animal reservoirs. Live animal markets, wildlife trade, and conversion of natural landscapes are high-risk for spillover events \cite{judson2019nosocomial, dharmarajan2022animal}. Numerous studies show 60–70% of emerging diseases are zoonotic in origin, arising from novel cross-species transmissions \cite{morens2020emerging}.

### C. The Role of Globalization and Urbanization

Modern urban centers foster dense populations and human contact, enabling rapid pathogen spread \cite{telenti2021after, gray2021mitigating}. Pandemic dynamics are shaped by both intrinsic viral properties and extrinsic environmental and social factors \cite{tabish2022age}.

## III. Viral Evolution, Genetic Plasticity, and Zoonotic Spillover

### A. Mutation Rates and Evolutionary Dynamics

RNA viruses mutate quickly due to error-prone replication, aiding host switching \cite{celik2020emerging}. Millions of viruses with zoonotic potential remain undiscovered \cite{carlson2020predict}. Influenza is particularly known for reassortment during co-infections \cite{harrington2021evolution}.

### B. Recombination and Adaptation Mechanisms

Recombination in coronaviruses yields novel variants exploiting host receptors \cite{neumann2023which}. SARS-CoV-2 demonstrated how mutations can increase transmissibility and immune evasion \cite{telenti2021after}.

### C. Zoonotic Spillover: Crossing the Species Barrier

Spillover depends on biological compatibility (e.g., receptor structure), exposure rate, and human susceptibility \cite{dharmarajan2022animal}. Bats, birds, and rodents are key reservoirs \cite{kummer2022henipaviruses}.

## IV. Comparative Analysis of Viral Families with Pandemic Potential

### A. Influenza Viruses

Influenza's segmented genome and animal reservoirs (birds, swine) enable reassortment and antigenic shifts \cite{neumann2023which}. Its history of pandemics makes it a primary candidate \cite{harrington2021evolution}.

### B. Coronaviruses

SARS, MERS, and COVID-19 are examples of zoonotic coronaviruses with pandemic spread \cite{morens2020emerging}. Recombination and mutation enhance their evolutionary capacity \cite{telenti2021after}.

### C. Henipaviruses and Paramyxoviruses

Nipah and Hendra viruses, though localized, are highly virulent with zoonotic origins \cite{kummer2022henipaviruses}.

### D. Filoviruses

Ebola and Marburg cause high-mortality outbreaks, but limited transmission routes make them less likely pandemic agents \cite{judson2019nosocomial}.

### E. Other Viral Agents

Arenaviruses, hantaviruses, and arboviruses (e.g., Zika) can cause epidemics. Their spread is constrained by vector ecology \cite{shanmugaraj2024overview, anonymous2020coronavirus}.

## V. Predictive Modeling, Surveillance, and the One Health Approach

### A. Predictive Factors and Risk Assessment

Models using viral genomics, host ecology, and tissue tropism predict pandemic risks \cite{carlson2021future, kamalrathne2023need}. Organizations like CDC and WHO integrate this data for pandemic preparedness \cite{tabish2022age}.

### B. Global Biosurveillance and Metagenomics

NGS enables identification of novel pathogens from wildlife \cite{quer2022next}. Projects like the Global Virome Project aim to map viral diversity \cite{carlson2020predict}.

### C. Surveillance at the Human–Animal Interface

Sampling in high-risk zones (markets, deforested areas) is key to early containment \cite{judson2019nosocomial}. Point-of-care diagnostics and AI analysis enhance detection \cite{gray2021mitigating}.

### D. Artificial Intelligence and Data-Driven Approaches

AI leverages genomics, mobility, and environment data to track outbreaks in real time \cite{anonymous2020coronavirus}. It refines estimates of transmission and risk \cite{telenti2021after}.

## VI. Global Preparedness, Policy Considerations, and Future Directions

### A. Proactive Preparedness and Early Warning

COVID-19 delays revealed the need for rapid sequencing, modeling, and global alerts \cite{gray2021mitigating}.

### B. Global Cooperation and Resource Allocation

Equity in vaccines, diagnostics, and research is essential \cite{mishra2023threat}. Global cooperation ensures timely pandemic response \cite{brooks2020before}.

### C. One Health Frameworks

Integrating human, animal, and ecosystem health via One Health enables better risk mitigation \cite{kamalrathne2023need}.

### D. Policy and Research Needs

Universal vaccines, rapid diagnostics, and public awareness strategies are needed \cite{neumann2023which, tabish2022age}.

## VII. Discussion

### A. Pandemic Probability

Evidence confirms that ecological shifts and viral evolution make future pandemics likely \cite{casadevall2024pandemics, morens2020emerging}.

### B. Leading Viral Candidates

Influenza and coronaviruses are the most likely culprits \cite{neumann2023which, harrington2021evolution}. Henipaviruses and filoviruses pose serious threats but with limited transmission \cite{kummer2022henipaviruses}.

### C. Evolutionary Dynamics and Public Health

Mutation-driven immune escape (e.g., SARS-CoV-2 variants) challenges vaccine efficacy, but timely response reduces impact \cite{telenti2021after}.

## VIII. Conclusion

Zoonotic spillovers, driven by environmental disruption and viral mutation, sustain high pandemic risk \cite{casadevall2024pandemics}. Influenza and coronaviruses remain top threats due to history and adaptability \cite{neumann2023which, morens2020emerging}. A coordinated One Health strategy, real-time surveillance, and equitable vaccine access are essential for mitigation \cite{kamalrathne2023need, brooks2020before}.
