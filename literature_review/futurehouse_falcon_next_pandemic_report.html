<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>The probability of a future pandemic has become a subject of
significant scientific concern in recent decades. Multiple lines of
evidence – from ecological and epidemiological studies to advances in
viral genomics and predictive modeling – converge on the conclusion that
the next pandemic is not a question of <em>if</em> but <em>when</em> .
Ongoing environmental modifications, increased global connectivity, and
the intensification of human activities at the animal–human interface
have collectively amplified the risk of zoonotic spillover events .
Among a broad array of viral candidates, influenza viruses and
coronaviruses consistently emerge as the most likely causes of the next
global outbreak due to their high mutation rates, capacity for rapid
genetic reassortment or recombination, and well‐documented history of
causing pandemics . This report reviews the interrelated risk factors,
discusses the evolutionary and ecological dynamics of viral emergence,
and presents a comparative analysis of the virus families most
frequently implicated in pandemic outbreaks. In addition, we discuss the
role of predictive models and surveillance systems aimed at early
detection and mitigating risk through a One Health approach.</p>

<h2 id="i.-introduction">I. Introduction</h2>
<p>A history marked by multiple pandemics – including the 1918 Spanish
influenza, the 2009 H1N1 influenza, the SARS outbreak of 2002–2003, the
MERS outbreak, and most recently the COVID-19 pandemic – underscores the
inevitability of future pandemics . Over recent decades, a multiplicity
of risk factors such as ecological disruption, global travel,
urbanization, intensified wildlife–human interactions, and agricultural
intensification has fundamentally altered the environment in which
pathogens evolve and emerge . The inherent genetic plasticity of RNA
viruses coupled with the expanding human footprint into natural habitats
has increased the reservoir of potential pathogens capable of crossing
species barriers . Although advances in biosurveillance and predictive
modeling have improved our understanding of viral spillover ,
uncertainty remains regarding the exact timing and identity of the next
pandemic pathogen. This report synthesizes current research insights
into pandemic probability and highlights the viral families that, by a
consensus of recent studies, appear most likely to cause the next global
outbreak.</p>

Epidemiological and Ecological Determinants of Pandemic Emergence</h2>
<h3 id="a.-global-environmental-and-social-drivers">A. Global
Environmental and Social Drivers</h3>
<p>Global climate change, deforestation, urban sprawl, and environmental
degradation have accelerated habitat disruption and forced wildlife into
closer proximity to human settlements . This increased contact creates
new opportunities for zoonotic viruses to cross species barriers . The
breakdown of historical ecological boundaries has facilitated viral
sharing across host species, expanding the “risk space” for emerging
infectious diseases . Additionally, globalized trade and rapid
international travel have enabled pathogens to spread over vast
distances .</p>
<h3 id="b.-humanwildlife-interactions-and-spillover-dynamics">B.
Human–Wildlife Interactions and Spillover Dynamics</h3>
<p>Encroachment into previously undisturbed ecosystems results in more
frequent interactions between humans and animal reservoirs. Live animal
markets, wildlife trade, and conversion of natural landscapes are
high-risk for spillover events . Numerous studies show 60–70% of
emerging diseases are zoonotic in origin, arising from novel
cross-species transmissions .</p>
<h3 id="c.-the-role-of-globalization-and-urbanization">C. The Role of
Globalization and Urbanization</h3>
<p>Modern urban centers foster dense populations and human contact,
enabling rapid pathogen spread . Pandemic dynamics are shaped by both

factors .</p>
