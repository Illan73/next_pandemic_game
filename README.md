# 🧩 Next Pandemic Game

**Exploring pandemic risk through viral families, spillovers & human behavior**

This educational project explores which viruses might cause the next human pandemic — and why. It aims to communicate complex virological and ecological concepts through interactive, accessible formats. This repository includes data, models, and background research to support a simulation that evaluates pandemic risk based on viral traits, transmission routes, environmental drivers, and human behavior.

## 📌 Objectives

- Identify high-risk viral families with pandemic potential.
- Explore zoonotic spillover dynamics.
- Understand the impact of human activity, climate change, and globalization on viral spread.
- Develop interactive tools for education and exploration.

## 🦠 High-Risk Viral Families

- **Coronaviruses (CoVs)** – fast mutation, pandemic history, bat origin.
- **Influenza Viruses** – reassortment, zoonosis from birds/pigs.
- **Paramyxoviruses** – Nipah, Hendra, high mortality.
- **Filoviruses** – Ebola, Marburg, limited outbreak containment.
- **Arboviruses** – mosquito-borne, climate-sensitive (Zika, Dengue).
- **Hantaviruses** – rodent-borne, increasing spillovers.
- **CCHF Virus** – tick-borne, ~30% fatality, range expansion.
- **Orthopoxviruses** – monkeypox and emerging variants.

## 🔍 Key Risk Factors

- High human-to-human transmissibility (esp. respiratory).
- RNA virus mutation rates enable rapid adaptation.
- Wide zoonotic reservoirs (bats, birds, rodents).
- Climate-driven vector range expansion.
- Dense urban populations and global connectivity.
